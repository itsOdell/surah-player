# surah-player
this was HEAVILY focused on javascript and not much css so it won't look that good. I could only add 4 surahs which is Fatiha and the last three surahs, reasons behind this is because the rest of the other surahs would take too much space. If you're wondering why the surah isn't starting, its because i downloaded the audio of the video, and the videos intro was too long. TL;DR: Doesn't look good, only 4 surahs inside, takes some time before audio starts playing
